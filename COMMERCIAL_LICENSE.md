## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use Clinical-Deid for free in my startup?

Yes, if you're not charging for de-identification services and it's for internal use only. Once you start monetizing, you need a commercial license.

### What if I'm a hospital using this internally?

Internal use for your own clinical operations is covered under Apache 2.0. No commercial license needed.

### Can I train my own model using your code?

Yes! The training code is Apache 2.0 licensed. You can train on your own data and use the resulting model commercially.

### What's the difference between the API and self-hosting?

- **API**: We host it, you pay per note, no infrastructure to manage
- **Self-host**: You run it, you pay for compute, more control

### Do you offer volume discounts?

Yes. Contact us for enterprise pricing on high-volume use cases.
